####G19 python keyboard thingy

[For this keyboard](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/4956) this gives you control over the screen, shows top, heat, etc..

This is from russo79 which is down now. Just using this for bug fixes and if I want to add stuff.

You can find the original online just search for:<br/>
`gnome15 linux`
