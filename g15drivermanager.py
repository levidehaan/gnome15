'''
This module is responsible for loading the available hardware drivers, and
choosing the best one to use. 

The best driver is always used when no driver is yet configured, other the 
configured driver is always used if possible. If it is not available,
or no longer supports the model for the associated device, then it will revert
back to using the best driver.

The "best driver" is simply the first driver that supports the associated
device.
